### How to make an issue/feature request that will be fixed/added:

If you are experiencing technical bug:

    What problem happened?
    What you did?
    Append screenshot if problem happen after interface interaction
    Example:
    Plugin hits breakpoint on File:123 when i click on button. [Screenshot showing widget with button, that caused such behavior]

If you are experiencing visual bug/inconsistency:

    Append screenshot showing a problem
    In what graph editor it happen?
    How problematic subject can be replicated?
    (I may not know everything about engine features. If it's not super usual thing, please explain how can i replicate what you have in screenshot)
    Example:
    [Screenshot showing the old element style] It happen in Blueprint Editor. You can get that node by enabling a "feature" and searching for "Node Name"

If you want feature:

    What feature?
    Why you want it?
    Example:
    It would be nice to see custom constructors for structures A, B, C

If you need something else:

    Write it in a way you want :)
